This script processes results from STRUCTURE software to identify the optimal number of clusters (K) and visualize population structure. STRUCTURE analysis was first conducted using the GUI version and the output was analyzed in R. This script begins by installing necessary packages, including devtools, ggplot2, and label.switching. After setting the working directory to the location of STRUCTURE result files, the script reads these files into R and summarizes the data. The evannoMethodStructure function is employed to apply the Evanno method for determining the optimal number of clusters (K), and the results are visualized using gridExtra. A STRUCTURE plot was then generated using the plotQ() function, displaying population structure for the optimal K with customizations for clarity and aesthetics. This comprehensive approach aids in interpreting population structure results effectively, producing publication-ready outputs.
