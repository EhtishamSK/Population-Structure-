This R script facilitates the analysis and visualization of STRUCTURE results using the pophelper package. STRUCTURE analysis was first conducted using the GUI version, and the output was analyzed in R. This script begins by installing necessary packages, including devtools, ggplot2, and label.switching. After setting the working directory to the location of STRUCTURE result files, the script reads these files into R and summarizes the data. The evannoMethodStructure function is employed to apply the Evanno method for determining the optimal number of clusters (K), and the results are visualized using gridExtra. The script also generates individual population structure plots for specific clusters, employing a custom color palette for enhanced visualization. Finally, it creates a barplot representation of the color palettes used in the analysis, providing a clear visual reference for the color assignments associated with different clusters. This comprehensive approach aids in interpreting population structure results effectively, producing publication-ready outputs.
